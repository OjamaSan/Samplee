# Samplee

Samplee is a small exploratory project built to prototype and test product ideas quickly.

The goal of this project is not engineering performance, but:
- exploring user flows and interactions
- validating UX hypotheses through lightweight prototypes
- better understanding technical constraints to collaborate more efficiently with engineers

This repository is part of my work as a Product Designer, used to experiment with ideas, AI-assisted workflows, and early product concepts.
